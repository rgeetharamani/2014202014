DETECTION OF PATHOLOGY PATTERNS IN DIABETIC RETINOPATHY FUNDUS IMAGES USING IMAGE PROCESSING

DATASET:
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/10kKX-iq-Uh05CqZOCVDYmIqZEq82CXZr/view?usp=sharing
        

PATH SELECTION:
        For this code dataset are available in local system's path. So we have to change path in code in order to run on other systems
        
        ex:  app.Image5_2.ImageSource='E:\MatlabProject\GT app\ex5.jpg'
        
        In this code image(ex5.jpg) obtain from 'E:\MatlabProject\GT app\ex5.jpg'
        
        
         we have to chage the path where we having the dataset. in above example i am having my dataset in GT app folder which is available inside MatlabProject folder and base disk is E:.
         so we have to give proper directory path where the data set is available.
